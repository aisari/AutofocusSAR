# AutofocusSAR

Codes and dataset for machine learning-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) autofocus algorithms.

After the paper is acceptted, the code will be opened fully.



# Folder Description

- ``Dataset``: contains all information about dataset. 
- ``ECELMs`` : contains code of  Ensemble Convolutional Extreme Learning Machine based autofocus algorithms, such as Bagging-CELMs.


# Algorithms

1. Bagging-CELMs: Fast SAR Autofocus based on Ensemble Convolutional Extreme Learning Machine


# Usage

## Dependencies

You need first to install our SAR library ( ``torchsar`` ) by excuting the following command:

Please see [torchsar](https://aisari.iridescent.ink/torchsar/) for details.

```bash
pip install torchsar
```
